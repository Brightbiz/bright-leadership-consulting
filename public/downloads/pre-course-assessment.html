  {type:'self-rating',id:'pre-sr-10',text:'I actively seek feedback from peers and direct reports to improve my leadership effectiveness.',competency:'Emotional Intelligence',maxScore:5},
  {type:'scenario',id:'pre-sc-1',scenario:'Your organisation is entering a new market segment. You have limited data but the board expects a recommendation within 48 hours. How do you approach this?',competency:'Strategic Thinking',maxScore:4,options:[{label:'Request more time to gather comprehensive data before making any recommendation',score:1,feedback:'While thorough, executive leaders must balance analysis with decisiveness under time pressure.'},{label:'Rely on your industry intuition and present a confident recommendation immediately',score:2,feedback:'Intuition matters, but the strongest leaders combine experience with structured rapid analysis.'},{label:'Conduct rapid analysis using available data, identify key assumptions, and present a recommendation with clear risk mitigation strategies',score:4,feedback:'Excellent. This balances speed, rigour, and transparency about uncertainties.'},{label:'Delegate the analysis entirely to your strategy team and review their findings',score:2,feedback:'Delegation is important, but this situation calls for your direct strategic involvement.'}]},
  {type:'scenario',id:'pre-sc-2',scenario:'During a critical leadership meeting, a respected peer publicly challenges your proposed restructuring plan, calling it "short-sighted." How do you respond?',competency:'Emotional Intelligence',maxScore:4,options:[{label:'Defend your plan firmly, pointing out the flaws in their perspective',score:1,feedback:'Defensiveness can escalate conflict and undermine collaborative problem-solving.'},{label:'Acknowledge their concern, ask clarifying questions, and suggest incorporating their perspective into a revised approach',score:4,feedback:'Outstanding. This demonstrates emotional maturity, active listening, and collaborative leadership.'},{label:'Remain silent and move to the next agenda item to avoid conflict',score:1,feedback:'Avoidance can signal a lack of conviction and miss an opportunity for constructive dialogue.'},{label:'Thank them for the feedback and offer to discuss it privately after the meeting',score:3,feedback:'Good composure, though addressing it openly can build trust with the wider group.'}]},
  {type:'scenario',id:'pre-sc-3',scenario:'You are leading a major digital transformation. Six months in, adoption rates are at 35% and key stakeholders are losing confidence. What is your next move?',competency:'Change Leadership',maxScore:4,options:[{label:'Push harder on compliance, setting mandatory adoption deadlines with consequences',score:1,feedback:'Forced compliance typically increases resistance and rarely achieves sustainable change.'},{label:'Identify the top resistors and engage them as change champions by addressing their specific concerns and involving them in solution design',score:4,feedback:'Converting resistors to champions is a hallmark of masterful change leadership.'},{label:'Scale back the initiative and take a more gradual approach',score:2,feedback:'While pragmatic, this risks losing momentum entirely. A targeted intervention is stronger.'},{label:'Launch an internal marketing campaign to improve awareness and excitement',score:2,feedback:'Communication helps, but at 35% adoption, the issue is likely deeper than awareness.'}]},
  {type:'scenario',id:'pre-sc-4',scenario:'Your highest-performing direct report asks to lead a cross-functional project that is outside their current expertise. They are passionate but inexperienced in this domain. How do you respond?',competency:'Team Empowerment',maxScore:4,options:[{label:'Assign them the project with full autonomy - their track record speaks for itself',score:2,feedback:'Autonomy without support in unfamiliar territory can set up even strong performers for failure.'},{label:'Decline the request and assign someone with relevant domain expertise instead',score:1,feedback:'This misses an opportunity to develop talent and may demotivate a key performer.'},{label:'Approve the assignment, pair them with a domain expert as mentor, and establish structured check-ins to provide support without micromanaging',score:4,feedback:'This maximises growth while managing risk - the mark of a leader who develops others strategically.'},{label:'Ask them to shadow the current domain expert for 3 months before deciding',score:2,feedback:'Measured but overly cautious. Growth happens through doing, with appropriate support structures.'}]},
  {type:'scenario',id:'pre-sc-5',scenario:'You must communicate a 15% budget reduction to your division while maintaining team morale and productivity. How do you frame this message?',competency:'Communication',maxScore:4,options:[{label:'Send a detailed email outlining the cuts and the financial rationale behind each one',score:1,feedback:'Email lacks the personal touch needed for difficult news. Leaders show up for hard conversations.'},{label:'Hold a team meeting, be transparent about the situation, outline your strategy for maintaining quality, and invite input on implementation',score:4,feedback:'Transparency, vision, and participative leadership build trust during challenging times.'},{label:'Minimise the severity and focus only on the positive opportunities that might emerge',score:1,feedback:'Sugar-coating erodes trust. People respect honest leadership over false optimism.'},{label:'Meet individually with each team lead to discuss impact and then announce the plan',score:3,feedback:'Good stakeholder management, though collective transparency can build broader team resilience.'}]},
  {type:'scenario',id:'pre-sc-6',scenario:'Two equally qualified internal candidates are vying for a critical leadership role. One is a long-tenured loyalist; the other is a recent hire with fresh perspective. The decision is contentious. How do you decide?',competency:'Decision Making',maxScore:4,options:[{label:'Reward loyalty and promote the long-tenured candidate to maintain cultural stability',score:2,feedback:'Loyalty matters, but the best decision aligns with strategic needs, not tenure alone.'},{label:'Choose the recent hire to signal that the organisation values innovation and new thinking',score:2,feedback:'Fresh thinking is valuable, but selecting based on signalling rather than fit can backfire.'},{label:'Define the strategic competencies the role demands, assess both candidates against them objectively, and make a transparent decision based on organisational need',score:4,feedback:'Excellent. Criteria-based decision-making ensures fairness and strategic alignment.'},{label:'Create two roles to avoid conflict and keep both candidates engaged',score:1,feedback:'Avoiding difficult decisions creates structural inefficiency and signals weak leadership.'}]},
  {type:'scenario',id:'pre-sc-7',scenario:'Your industry is being disrupted by AI and automation. Your board wants a 5-year innovation strategy, but your leadership team is divided between aggressive investment and cautious observation. What do you recommend?',competency:'Innovation',maxScore:4,options:[{label:'Recommend waiting for competitors to move first and then fast-following their approach',score:1,feedback:'Fast-following often means falling behind. In disruptive environments, proactive positioning is essential.'},{label:'Propose a balanced approach: invest in strategic pilot programmes, create an innovation lab, and establish clear metrics for scaling successful experiments',score:4,feedback:'This combines boldness with prudence - the hallmark of innovation leadership at the executive level.'},{label:'Go all-in with aggressive investment to establish first-mover advantage',score:2,feedback:'Bold, but without structured experimentation, this carries significant downside risk.'},{label:'Commission an external consultancy to develop the strategy on your behalf',score:1,feedback:'Outsourcing core strategy signals a lack of internal capability and ownership.'}]},
  {type:'scenario',id:'pre-sc-8',scenario:'You are presenting quarterly results to the board. Revenue is down 8%, but your strategic initiatives are showing early positive indicators. The chairman appears sceptical. How do you handle the presentation?',competency:'Executive Presence',maxScore:4,options:[{label:'Focus entirely on the positive leading indicators and downplay the revenue shortfall',score:1,feedback:'Selective presentation erodes board trust. Credibility requires acknowledging reality.'},{label:'Present the full picture with confidence: acknowledge the shortfall, explain root causes, demonstrate the strategic trajectory with data, and outline specific corrective actions with timelines',score:4,feedback:'Masterful. This shows command of the situation, transparency, and strategic confidence.'},{label:'Apologise for the results and promise to do better next quarter',score:1,feedback:'Apologies without analysis signal a lack of strategic control and executive confidence.'},{label:'Open with the revenue challenge, then quickly pivot to the long-term strategy and growth roadmap',score:3,feedback:'Good structure, but adding specific corrective actions would demonstrate stronger executive command.'}]},
  {type:'scenario',id:'pre-sc-9',scenario:'A key client relationship is deteriorating due to service quality issues. Your team blames resource constraints; the client is threatening to leave. How do you intervene?',competency:'Decision Making',maxScore:4,options:[{label:'Personally visit the client, listen to their concerns, co-create a recovery plan with committed timelines, and reallocate internal resources to deliver on promises',score:4,feedback:'Executive-level relationship management combined with decisive resource allocation demonstrates leadership maturity.'},{label:'Ask your account manager to handle it and report back with an update',score:1,feedback:'When key relationships are at risk, senior leaders must step in personally.'},{label:'Offer the client a discount to retain the contract while you fix internal issues',score:2,feedback:'Discounts treat symptoms, not causes. The client wants quality, not price concessions.'},{label:'Escalate the resource constraints to the COO and request additional headcount',score:2,feedback:'Helpful, but doesn\'t address the immediate client relationship crisis.'}]},
  {type:'scenario',id:'pre-sc-10',scenario:'You have been invited to deliver a keynote at a major industry conference. Your topic is "The Future of Leadership in the Age of AI." How do you prepare?',competency:'Executive Presence',maxScore:4,options:[{label:'Ask your communications team to write the speech and rehearse it the day before',score:1,feedback:'Authenticity and personal expertise are essential for executive credibility at this level.'},{label:'Decline the invitation - public speaking at this scale is outside your comfort zone',score:1,feedback:'Executive leaders must lean into visibility opportunities. Growth requires discomfort.'},{label:'Research current trends, synthesise your own leadership insights and experiences, craft a narrative that combines data with storytelling, and rehearse with feedback from trusted advisors',score:4,feedback:'This shows intellectual rigour, personal authenticity, and strategic preparation - true executive presence.'},{label:'Prepare a data-heavy slide deck covering all major AI leadership trends comprehensively',score:2,feedback:'Data matters, but executive keynotes require narrative, vision, and personal connection with the audience.'}]}
