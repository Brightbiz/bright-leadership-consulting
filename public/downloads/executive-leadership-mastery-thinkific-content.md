### Lesson 1.1: Defining Leadership

**Video Script (8-10 minutes):**

Welcome to the Executive Leadership Mastery Program. I'm thrilled you've chosen to invest in your leadership journey.

Let me start with a question that seems simple but has profound implications: What exactly is leadership?

Leadership is not a title. It's not a corner office. It's not the number of people who report to you.

Leadership is the ability to inspire, influence, and guide others toward a shared goal. It's about creating a vision that others want to follow—not because they have to, but because they choose to.

Think about the most impactful leader you've ever encountered. Perhaps it was a boss, a teacher, a coach, or even a peer. What made them memorable? I'd wager it wasn't their job title. It was how they made you feel. It was their ability to see potential in you that you couldn't see in yourself.

**The Leadership Paradox**

Here's what makes leadership fascinating: the most powerful leaders are often the most humble. They understand that leadership isn't about being in charge—it's about taking care of those in your charge.

Simon Sinek puts it beautifully: "Leadership is not about being in control. It's about creating an environment in which people can do their best work."

**Key Takeaways:**
- Leadership is influence, not authority
- Great leaders inspire voluntary followership
- Leadership can exist at any level of an organization

**Reflection Exercise:**
Think about a time when someone influenced your behaviour without having formal authority over you. What did they do? How did they do it? Write down three specific behaviours they demonstrated.

### Lesson 1.2: Traits of Effective Leaders

**Video Script (10-12 minutes):**

What separates good leaders from great ones? Researchers have spent decades trying to answer this question.

While there's no single formula, certain traits consistently appear in the most effective leaders:

**1. Integrity**
Great leaders do what they say they'll do. They're consistent in their values, whether anyone is watching or not. Trust is the foundation of leadership, and integrity is the foundation of trust.

**2. Vision**
Effective leaders can see beyond the immediate. They paint a compelling picture of a future worth striving for. But here's the key—they don't just have a vision; they can communicate it in a way that resonates emotionally with others.

**3. Emotional Intelligence**
The ability to understand and manage your own emotions, while also reading and responding to the emotions of others, is perhaps the most critical leadership trait. We'll explore this in depth in Module 5.

**4. Courage**
Leadership requires making difficult decisions. It requires having hard conversations. It requires standing firm when it would be easier to compromise your values.

**5. Humility**
The best leaders know they don't have all the answers. They hire people smarter than themselves. They ask questions more than they give answers. They give credit freely and accept blame personally.

**6. Adaptability**
In a world of constant change, rigid leaders become obsolete. The ability to pivot, learn, and evolve is essential.

**Activity: Leadership Trait Self-Assessment**
Rate yourself 1-10 on each of these six traits. Be honest—this is for your development, not your ego. Identify your top two strengths and the one area that needs the most work. This will be your focus throughout the program.

### Lesson 1.3: Leadership vs. Management

**Video Script (8-10 minutes):**

"Managers do things right. Leaders do the right things." — Peter Drucker

This isn't about one being better than the other. Both are essential. The most effective executives master both skill sets.

**Management focuses on:**
- Planning and budgeting
- Organizing and staffing
- Controlling and problem-solving
- Producing predictable results

**Leadership focuses on:**
- Establishing direction
- Aligning people
- Motivating and inspiring
- Producing change and movement

Here's a simple way to think about it: Management is about the present. Leadership is about the future.

A manager asks, "How can we do this more efficiently?" A leader asks, "Should we be doing this at all?"

**The Manager's Dilemma**
Most people are promoted into leadership roles because they were excellent individual contributors. But the skills that made you a great accountant, engineer, or salesperson are not the same skills that make you a great leader.

The transition from "doer" to "leader" is one of the most challenging professional transitions you'll ever make. You have to let go of the work that defined you to embrace the work of developing others.

**Key Insight:**
You can manage inventory, budgets, and processes. But you cannot manage people. You can only lead them.

---

### Lesson 1.4: The Impact of Leadership

**Video Script (10-12 minutes):**

Leadership isn't just about feeling good—it has measurable, tangible impacts on organizational performance.

**Research Findings:**

- Gallup research shows that managers account for 70% of the variance in employee engagement scores
- Companies with highly engaged workforces outperform their peers by 147% in earnings per share
- The cost of disengaged employees is estimated at £52 billion annually in the UK alone

**The Ripple Effect**

Your leadership doesn't just affect your direct reports. It creates ripples throughout the organization.

When you lead with clarity and purpose, your team gains confidence. That confidence shows up in their work, their interactions with clients, and even in how they lead their own teams.

Conversely, toxic leadership creates toxic cultures. Fear spreads. Innovation dies. The best people leave, and those who remain disengage.

**Case Study Analysis: "The Unofficial Leader"**

*Scenario:* In the marketing department, Sarah is a junior analyst, but everyone—including senior members—goes to her for advice, creative input, and conflict mediation. Her manager, Tom, holds the official title but often struggles to get team buy-in on his initiatives.

*Discussion Questions:*
1. What defines leadership in this scenario?
2. What leadership traits does Sarah exhibit?
3. How does her influence differ from Tom's authority?
4. What could Tom do to become a more effective leader?

---

### Lesson 1.5: Developing Your Leadership Style

**Video Script (12-15 minutes):**

There is no single "right" way to lead. The most effective leaders develop an authentic style that leverages their unique strengths.

**Leadership Style Assessment**

Think about how you naturally approach leadership situations:

**Directive vs. Participative**
Do you prefer to provide clear direction, or do you involve others in decision-making?

**Task-Focused vs. Relationship-Focused**
Do you prioritize getting the work done, or building strong connections?

**Transformational vs. Transactional**
Do you inspire through vision and purpose, or through clear expectations and rewards?

Neither end of these spectrums is inherently better. The key is self-awareness and situational adaptability.

**The Situational Leadership Model**

The best leaders adapt their style based on:
- The competence of the team member
- The complexity of the task
- The urgency of the situation
- The stakes involved

A new employee handling an unfamiliar task needs more direction. An experienced expert on a familiar project needs space and autonomy.

**Your Leadership Development Plan**

Based on your self-assessment, create a simple development plan:
1. One strength to leverage more intentionally
2. One area to develop over the next 90 days
3. One specific behaviour to start immediately

---

5. Reflection: Describe a leader who significantly influenced your career. What specific traits and behaviours made them effective?

---

### Role-Play Exercise: "First Team Meeting"

**Scenario:** You have just been promoted to lead a team you were once a part of.

**Your Goal:** Establish your new role as a leader, not just a peer, while maintaining trust and morale. Set expectations for the team's future direction.

1. How will you acknowledge the change in dynamics?
2. What's your vision for the team?
3. How will you balance asserting authority with maintaining relationships?

**Practice Tips:**
- Record yourself giving the speech
- Focus on confident, open body language
- Be authentic—don't try to be someone you're not

# MODULE 2: Leadership vs. Management

## Module Overview
**Duration:** 2-3 hours  
**Format:** Video lessons, case studies, practical exercises  
**CPD Points:** 2

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, participants will be able to:
1. Clearly articulate the distinct roles of a leader versus a manager
2. Identify situations that require a management mindset versus a leadership mindset
3. Analyse the "Manager's Dilemma" and learn to balance administrative duties with people development
4. Develop strategies to shift from task execution to vision casting

---

### Lesson 2.1: The Core Differences (Process vs. People)

**Video Script (10-12 minutes):**

"Management is about complexity; leadership is about change." This single sentence captures the essence of what we're exploring in this module.

**The Manager's World**
Managers navigate complexity. They create systems, processes, and structures that allow organizations to function predictably. Without good management, chaos ensues.

A manager asks:
- How do we allocate resources?
- What's the timeline?
- Who's responsible for each task?
- How do we measure progress?

**The Leader's World**
Leaders navigate change. They see what's possible and mobilize people toward that possibility. Without good leadership, organizations become stagnant.

A leader asks:
- Where are we going?
- Why does it matter?
- How do we inspire commitment?
- What obstacles must we overcome?

**The Integration Challenge**

Here's the reality: most leadership roles require both skill sets. You can't lead people toward a vision if the systems and processes to get there don't exist. And you can't manage processes effectively if people aren't motivated to execute them.

The most successful executives develop what I call "ambidextrous leadership"—the ability to switch fluidly between management and leadership modes depending on what the situation demands.

---

### Lesson 2.2: The Managerial Mindset: Efficiency and Control

**Video Script (8-10 minutes):**

Let's be clear: management is not a dirty word. Organizations need skilled managers.

**When Management Matters Most:**
- Operational consistency and quality control
- Resource allocation and budgeting
- Project planning and execution
- Performance tracking and accountability
- Risk mitigation and compliance

**The Manager's Toolkit:**
- Gantt charts and project plans
- Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)
- Budget reports and variance analysis
- Performance reviews and feedback systems

**The Danger Zone**

Management becomes problematic when it's the only mode a leader operates in. Over-management leads to:
- Micromanagement and loss of autonomy
- Focus on inputs (hours worked) vs. outcomes (results achieved)
- Bureaucracy that stifles innovation
- Disengaged employees who feel like cogs in a machine

**Reflection:** Think about your current role. What percentage of your time is spent on management activities versus leadership activities? Is that balance right?

---

### Lesson 2.3: The Leadership Mindset: Vision and Influence

**Video Script (10-12 minutes):**

Leadership is fundamentally about creating meaning. It's about answering the question, "Why should I follow you?"

**The Vision Imperative**

People don't follow spreadsheets. They follow dreams. They follow purpose. They follow leaders who make them feel like they're part of something bigger than themselves.

Your job as a leader is to:
1. **See** the future more clearly than others
2. **Articulate** that future in a compelling way
3. **Connect** that future to what matters to your team
4. **Mobilize** people to take action toward that future

**Influence Without Authority**

True leadership doesn't require formal power. The ability to influence without authority is perhaps the most valuable skill you can develop.

This influence comes from:
- **Credibility:** Do people trust your competence and character?
- **Relationships:** Have you invested in genuine connections?
- **Communication:** Can you make complex ideas simple and compelling?
- **Empathy:** Do people feel understood by you?

**The Leadership Vacuum**

When leaders fail to lead—when they focus only on management—a vacuum forms. Someone else will fill that vacuum, whether you intended it or not. The question is: will it be the right person with the right values?

---

### Lesson 2.4: Balancing the Two Roles

**Video Script (12-15 minutes):**

The art of executive effectiveness is knowing when to manage and when to lead.

**The Balance Framework:**

| Situation | Emphasis |
|-----------|----------|
| Crisis requiring immediate action | Management |
| Strategic uncertainty | Leadership |
| New team member learning the job | Management |
| Team facing change or transition | Leadership |
| Operational problems to solve | Management |
| Innovation or growth initiative | Leadership |

**Practical Strategies:**

1. **Time Block Intentionally**
   Reserve time specifically for leadership activities: thinking, visioning, developing people. If it's not on your calendar, it won't happen.

2. **Delegate Management, Lead What Matters**
   You don't have to do all the managing yourself. Build systems and develop people who can handle operational details.

3. **Ask Different Questions**
   When you find yourself deep in the weeds, pause and ask: "Is this the best use of my time right now?" "What's the leadership work I'm avoiding?"

4. **Create Rituals**
   Establish regular practices that force leadership thinking: weekly one-on-ones focused on development, monthly strategic reviews, quarterly vision-casting sessions.

---

### Lesson 2.5: Transitioning from Doing to Leading

**Video Script (10-12 minutes):**

The hardest part of becoming a leader is letting go of what made you successful as an individual contributor.

**The Identity Shift**

Your value used to come from what you produced. Now your value comes from what your team produces.

This is an identity-level shift, not just a skills shift. It requires mourning the loss of your old self and embracing a new definition of success.

**Signs You Haven't Made the Transition:**
- You're the bottleneck—nothing moves without your approval
- You redo your team's work instead of teaching them to improve
- You feel guilty when you're not "doing" tangible work
- You handle problems yourself because "it's faster"
- Your calendar is packed with tactical work, not strategic work

**Making the Shift:**

1. **Redefine Your Value Proposition**
   You're no longer paid to do the work. You're paid to ensure the work gets done—and to develop the people who do it.

2. **Start Saying No**
   Every time you say yes to doing something yourself, you're saying no to developing someone else's capability.

3. **Celebrate Different Wins**
   Track your team's growth, not just your personal output. Feel proud when someone on your team succeeds.

4. **Get Comfortable with Discomfort**
   Watching someone struggle to learn (when you could do it perfectly) is hard. But that discomfort is the price of developing leaders.

---

### Case Study: "The Visionary vs. The Executor"

**Scenario:** Two departments are tasked with launching a new product.

**Department A** is led by a visionary leader who inspires the team with the product's potential but fails to set clear deadlines or processes, leading to confusion.

**Department B** is led by a highly efficient manager who creates detailed project plans and monitors every task, but the team feels uninspired and disengaged from the "why" behind the work.

Both departments are struggling.

**Discussion Questions:**
1. Which leader is more effective and why?
2. What is each department missing?
3. How could each leader adopt skills from the other to improve their team's performance?

**Analysis Framework:**
Create a two-column chart listing the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. Then develop a "best of both" leadership model.

---

### Role-Play Exercise: "Budget Cuts"

**Scenario:** You have just been told you need to cut your team's operational budget by 15%.

**Manager Approach:** Focus on the practical application—going through line items, identifying cuts, implementing changes efficiently.

**Leader Approach:** Focus on the people aspect—explaining the "why," addressing fears about job security, rallying the team to find innovative solutions.

**Your Challenge:** Practice presenting this news using both approaches. Notice how each feels different. Where do you naturally gravitate?

---

# MODULE 3: Building Trust in Your Team

## Module Overview
**Duration:** 3-4 hours  
**Format:** Video lessons, trust assessments, repair exercises  
**CPD Points:** 3

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, participants will be able to:
1. Deconstruct trust using the "Trust Equation"
2. Foster psychological safety to encourage innovation
3. Identify and address the five dysfunctions of a team
4. Apply a structured apology framework to repair broken trust

---

### Lesson 3.1: The Anatomy of Trust (The Trust Equation)

**Video Script (12-15 minutes):**

Trust is the foundation upon which all leadership is built. Without trust, you have compliance at best, resistance at worst.

**The Trust Equation**

Charles Green developed a brilliant formula for understanding trust:

```
Trust = (Credibility + Reliability + Intimacy) / Self-Orientation
```

Let's break this down:

**Credibility (C)**
Do people believe you know what you're talking about? This comes from expertise, track record, and honest acknowledgment of what you don't know.

*Build credibility by:*
- Demonstrating competence consistently
- Admitting mistakes and knowledge gaps
- Sharing relevant experience and expertise
- Being honest when you don't have the answer

**Reliability (R)**
Do you do what you say you'll do? This is about consistency of action over time.

*Build reliability by:*
- Following through on commitments—every time
- Being punctual and meeting deadlines
- Communicating proactively when you can't deliver
- Creating predictable patterns of behaviour

**Intimacy (I)**
Do people feel safe sharing their concerns, fears, and half-formed ideas with you? This is about emotional safety.

*Build intimacy by:*
- Keeping confidences absolutely
- Showing vulnerability yourself
- Listening without judgment
- Remembering personal details

**Self-Orientation (S)**
Here's the critical part—it's in the denominator. The more self-focused you are, the less people trust you.

*Reduce self-orientation by:*
- Focusing on others' needs before your own
- Asking questions more than giving answers
- Giving credit to others
- Being genuinely curious about other perspectives

**The Trust Multiplier Effect**

When people trust you, everything becomes easier. Decisions happen faster. Conflicts resolve more smoothly. People give you the benefit of the doubt.

When trust is low, every interaction is friction. People second-guess your motives. Communication breaks down. Energy that should go toward work goes toward self-protection.

---

### Lesson 3.2: Psychological Safety & Vulnerability

**Video Script (12-15 minutes):**

Google's Project Aristotle studied what makes teams successful. Their number one finding? Psychological safety.

**What is Psychological Safety?**

Amy Edmondson defines it as "a shared belief that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking."

In psychologically safe teams:
- People ask questions without fear of looking stupid
- Mistakes are reported early, not hidden
- Dissenting opinions are welcomed
- People admit when they don't know something
- Ideas are challenged, but people aren't attacked

**The Vulnerability Paradox**

Here's what many leaders get wrong: they think vulnerability makes them look weak. In fact, appropriate vulnerability is one of the most powerful trust-building tools.

When you say, "I don't know," you give permission for others to admit the same. When you share a failure, you create space for others to take risks. When you ask for help, you demonstrate that asking for help is acceptable.

**Vulnerability ≠ Weakness**

Let me be clear: vulnerability doesn't mean sharing everything. It doesn't mean crying in meetings or dumping your personal problems on your team.

Strategic vulnerability means:
- Admitting when you're uncertain
- Acknowledging your limitations
- Sharing relevant learning experiences (including failures)
- Asking for input and genuinely considering it

**Creating Psychological Safety: Leader Behaviours**

1. **Respond positively to questions and concerns**
   Never punish someone for speaking up, even if the message is uncomfortable.

2. **Frame failure as learning**
   Instead of "Who's responsible for this failure?" ask "What can we learn from this?"

3. **Model curiosity**
   Ask genuine questions. Say "I wonder if..." instead of "You should..."

4. **Call out your own mistakes first**
   When reviewing a project, start with what you could have done better.

---

### Lesson 3.3: The Five Dysfunctions of a Team

**Video Script (15-18 minutes):**

Patrick Lencioni's model identifies five interconnected dysfunctions that undermine team performance. Importantly, they build on each other—you can't fix the higher ones without addressing the foundations.

**Dysfunction #1: Absence of Trust**
Team members are unwilling to be vulnerable with each other. They hide mistakes, don't ask for help, and spend energy on self-protection.

*Signs:*
- Reluctance to ask for help
- Holding back opinions in meetings
- Defensiveness when receiving feedback

*The Fix:*
Leaders must go first. Share your own vulnerabilities. Create structured opportunities for personal sharing.

**Dysfunction #2: Fear of Conflict**
Without trust, people avoid healthy debate. Issues go undiscussed, festering beneath the surface.

*Signs:*
- Artificial harmony in meetings
- Back-channel politics
- Passive-aggressive behaviour

*The Fix:*
Encourage constructive conflict. Distinguish between personal attacks (bad) and idea debates (good). Model how to disagree respectfully.

**Dysfunction #3: Lack of Commitment**
Without healthy conflict, people don't buy in to decisions. They nod in meetings but don't truly commit.

*Signs:*
- Ambiguity about decisions and priorities
- Revisiting decisions repeatedly
- Lack of follow-through

*The Fix:*
Ensure everyone's voice is heard before decisions are made. Even if someone disagrees, they can commit if they felt heard.

**Dysfunction #4: Avoidance of Accountability**
Without commitment, people don't hold each other accountable. Standards slip. Performance suffers.

*Signs:*
- Tolerance of poor performance
- Missed deadlines without consequence
- Leader as the only source of accountability

*The Fix:*
Create clear standards and make them visible. Encourage peer accountability, not just top-down.

**Dysfunction #5: Inattention to Results**
Without accountability, people prioritize their individual goals over team goals. Ego and status matter more than collective success.

*Signs:*
- Focus on personal success over team success
- Celebrating individual achievements while team fails
- Hoarding information or resources

*The Fix:*
Define collective goals clearly. Reward team success, not just individual achievement.

### Lesson 3.4: Repairing Broken Trust

**Video Script (12-15 minutes):**

Trust is hard to build and easy to break. But here's the good news: trust can be repaired if you approach it correctly.

**The 4 R's of Trust Repair**

**1. Recognition**
Acknowledge specifically what you did wrong. Vague apologies ("Sorry if you were offended") don't work. Be specific: "I broke my promise when I..."

**2. Responsibility**
Own it fully. No excuses, no blame-shifting. "It was my decision and I got it wrong."

**3. Remorse**
Express genuine regret for the impact. Focus on how your actions affected others, not how bad you feel.

**4. Resolution**
Explain what you will do differently. This is where you rebuild—by demonstrating changed behaviour over time.

**The Trust Recovery Timeline**

Trust isn't restored through a single conversation. It's restored through consistent behaviour over time. After a breach:
- The apology opens the door
- Changed behaviour over weeks/months walks through it
- Time (and consistency) closes the gap

**When Trust Can't Be Restored**

Sometimes trust is too damaged to repair. If you've violated core values, if the pattern has repeated too many times, or if the relationship is fundamentally broken, it may be time to acknowledge that and make different decisions about the relationship.

---

### Lesson 3.5: Leading with Integrity and Consistency

**Video Script (10-12 minutes):**

Integrity is the daily practice of building trust through aligned words and actions.

**The Consistency Imperative**

People trust consistency. They trust predictability. When you behave the same way regardless of who's watching, regardless of the circumstances, trust grows.

**Integrity in Practice:**

1. **Say what you mean**
   Don't soften messages to the point of ambiguity. Be kind, but be clear.

2. **Do what you say**
   Under-promise and over-deliver. If you can't keep a commitment, communicate immediately.

3. **Be the same person everywhere**
   How you treat the intern should match how you treat the CEO. Your behaviour in private should match your behaviour in public.

4. **Hold yourself to the same standards**
   If you expect your team to be on time, you must be on time. If you expect honesty, you must be honest.

**The Integrity Test**

Before any decision, ask yourself:
- Would I be comfortable if this decision was made public?
- Would I be proud if my team made the same decision?
- Am I treating others as I would want to be treated?

---

### Case Study: "The Broken Promise"

**Scenario:** A manager, Alex, promised his team that if they worked two weekends to meet a critical deadline, they would all receive a spot bonus and extra time off. The team delivered, but due to a last-minute policy change from senior leadership, Alex was told he could not grant the bonuses or extra PTO. The team's morale has plummeted, and trust in Alex is shattered.

**Discussion Questions:**
1. What were the components of trust that were broken?
2. How should Alex address the situation with his team?
3. What steps can he take to begin rebuilding trust, even if he can't deliver on the original promise?

**Analysis Exercise:**
Write out the conversation Alex should have with his team, using the 4 R's framework.

---

### Role-Play Exercise: "Repairing Trust After a Mistake"

**Scenario:** You, as the team leader, made a decision that resulted in a project failing. Your team is now hesitant to follow your direction on a new project.

**Your Goal:** Use the 4 R's (Recognition, Responsibility, Remorse, Resolution) to address the past failure and regain your team's confidence.

**Practice Points:**
- Be specific about what went wrong
- Don't make excuses
- Focus on their experience, not your intentions
- Commit to specific changed behaviours

---

# MODULE 4: Effective Communication Skills

## Module Overview
**Duration:** 3-4 hours  
**Format:** Video lessons, communication exercises, feedback practice  
**CPD Points:** 3

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, participants will be able to:
1. Understand diverse communication styles
2. Master active listening and non-verbal communication
3. Construct clear, impactful messages
4. Navigate difficult conversations with confidence

---

### Lesson 4.1: The Communication Loop & Barriers

**Video Script (10-12 minutes):**

Communication seems simple: I say something, you hear it. But in reality, communication is remarkably complex, and most of our problems as leaders stem from communication failures.

**The Communication Loop**

1. **Sender** formulates a message
2. **Encoding** - the message is put into words/gestures
3. **Channel** - the medium used (email, phone, face-to-face)
4. **Decoding** - the receiver interprets the message
5. **Receiver** creates meaning
6. **Feedback** - the receiver responds

At each stage, distortion can occur.

**Common Communication Barriers:**

**Physical Barriers**
- Distance, noise, technical issues
- Channel choice (email for sensitive topics)

**Psychological Barriers**
- Stress, emotions, biases
- Assumptions about the other person

**Semantic Barriers**
- Jargon, acronyms, technical language
- Cultural differences in meaning

**The Curse of Knowledge**

Once you know something, you find it hard to remember what it was like not to know it. This leads to assumptions about what others understand.

*The Fix:* Always check for understanding. Ask, "What's your understanding of what we just discussed?"

---

### Lesson 4.2: Active Listening Techniques

**Video Script (12-15 minutes):**

Most people do not listen with the intent to understand. They listen with the intent to reply.

**The Levels of Listening:**

**Level 1: Ignoring**
Not really listening at all. Waiting for your turn to speak.

**Level 2: Pretending**
Making the right noises but not truly engaged.

**Level 3: Selective**
Hearing only what confirms your existing views.

**Level 4: Attentive**
Focused on the words, but not the meaning behind them.

**Level 5: Empathic**
Listening to understand the full message—words, emotions, what's unsaid.

**Active Listening Techniques:**

**1. Be Present**
Put away distractions. Make eye contact. Your body should communicate attention.

**2. Paraphrase**
"So what I'm hearing is..." Repeat back what you heard to confirm understanding.

**3. Ask Clarifying Questions**
"Can you tell me more about that?" "What did you mean by...?"

**4. Reflect Feelings**
"It sounds like you're frustrated about..." Acknowledge the emotion, not just the content.

**5. Summarize**
At the end, summarize the key points to ensure alignment.

**6. Pause Before Responding**
Resist the urge to respond immediately. Let the other person fully finish.

### Lesson 4.3: Non-Verbal Communication & Body Language

**Video Script (10-12 minutes):**

Albert Mehrabian's research suggests that only 7% of communication is the actual words. The rest is tone of voice (38%) and body language (55%).

While these specific percentages are debated, the core insight is clear: how you say something matters as much as what you say.

**Body Language Basics:**

**Posture**
- Open posture signals confidence and receptivity
- Crossed arms can signal defensiveness
- Leaning in shows engagement; leaning back shows disinterest

**Eye Contact**
- Appropriate eye contact builds connection
- Too little suggests discomfort or dishonesty
- Too much can feel aggressive

**Facial Expressions**
- Your face often betrays your true feelings
- Practice awareness of your expressions
- A genuine smile engages the eyes, not just the mouth

**Gestures**
- Use hands to emphasize points
- Avoid fidgeting, which signals nervousness
- Mirror the other person's energy appropriately

**Reading Others**

Watch for incongruence—when body language contradicts words. If someone says "I'm fine" while looking at the floor with slumped shoulders, believe the body language.

### Lesson 4.4: Tailoring Your Message to the Audience

**Video Script (10-12 minutes):**

The same message, delivered the same way, will land differently depending on who's receiving it.

**Know Your Audience**

Before communicating, ask:
- What do they already know about this topic?
- What do they care about?
- What concerns or objections might they have?
- What action do I want them to take?

**Communication Style Preferences:**

**Analytical Types**
Want data, facts, and logical arguments. Give them details and time to process.

**Driver Types**
Want the bottom line first. Be brief, direct, and action-oriented.

**Expressive Types**
Want the big picture and how it affects people. Paint a vision and connect emotionally.

**Amiable Types**
Want consensus and harmony. Emphasize team impact and give time for questions.

**Adapting Without Being Inauthentic**

Adapting your style isn't manipulation—it's respect. You're making it easier for others to receive your message.

---

### Lesson 4.5: Delivering Difficult News

**Video Script (12-15 minutes):**

Leadership requires delivering messages people don't want to hear. The way you deliver these messages defines your leadership.

**The Framework for Difficult Conversations:**

**1. Prepare**
- Know your key message
- Anticipate reactions and questions
- Choose the right time and setting

**2. Get to the Point**
Don't bury bad news in small talk. Respect people enough to be direct.

**3. Explain the "Why"**
Help people understand the reasoning. Even if they disagree, understanding reduces resistance.

**4. Acknowledge the Impact**
Don't minimize or dismiss how the news affects people. "I know this isn't what you wanted to hear."

**5. Provide a Path Forward**
What happens next? What support is available? Where do people go with questions?

**6. Allow Processing Time**
People may need time before they can engage constructively.

**What NOT to Do:**

- Don't blame others
- Don't make promises you can't keep
- Don't say "I know how you feel" (you don't)
- Don't rush to problem-solving before they've processed

# MODULE 5: Emotional Intelligence (EQ)

## Module Overview
**Duration:** 3-4 hours  
**Format:** Video lessons, self-assessments, practice scenarios  
**CPD Points:** 3

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, participants will be able to:
1. Define the pillars of Emotional Intelligence
2. Identify personal triggers and self-regulate
3. Apply empathy to build relationships
4. Use EQ in resolving conflict

---

### Lesson 5.1: Self-Awareness: Knowing Your Triggers

**Video Script (12-15 minutes):**

Emotional Intelligence (EQ) may be the single most important predictor of leadership success. Research by Daniel Goleman shows that EQ matters twice as much as IQ for outstanding performance in leadership roles.

**The Four Pillars of EQ:**

1. **Self-Awareness** - Knowing your emotions, strengths, weaknesses, and triggers
2. **Self-Management** - Regulating your emotions and behaviour
3. **Social Awareness** - Understanding others' emotions and organizational dynamics
4. **Relationship Management** - Using awareness to build and maintain relationships

Let's start with the foundation: self-awareness.

**What Are Your Triggers?**

A trigger is any stimulus that provokes a strong emotional reaction, often disproportionate to the situation.

Common leadership triggers:
- Feeling disrespected or undermined
- Having your competence questioned
- Loss of control
- Unfairness or injustice
- Being excluded from decisions
- Criticism, especially public

**The Trigger Identification Exercise:**

Think of the last three times you had a strong negative emotional reaction at work. For each:
1. What happened?
2. What emotion did you feel?
3. What need was threatened (respect, control, fairness)?
4. How did you respond?
5. What was the impact of your response?

**The Self-Awareness Practice**

Start a simple daily practice:
- At the end of each day, identify one moment when you felt a strong emotion
- Name the emotion specifically (not just "bad" but "frustrated" or "anxious")
- Consider what triggered it
- Assess how you responded

Over time, you'll see patterns—and awareness is the first step to change.

---

### Lesson 5.2: Self-Management: Regulation Under Pressure

**Video Script (12-15 minutes):**

Self-awareness without self-management is like a diagnosis without treatment. Knowing your triggers is useless if you can't control your response.

**The Amygdala Hijack**

When we perceive a threat (physical or social), our amygdala triggers a "fight or flight" response. Blood flows away from the rational brain. We react instinctively.

In our ancestors, this kept us alive. In a modern workplace, it makes us say things we regret in emails.

**The 6-Second Rule**

It takes approximately 6 seconds for the initial neurochemical surge to pass. If you can create a pause—a moment of space—you can respond rather than react.

**Practical Regulation Techniques:**

**1. The Physiological Reset**
- Take a deep breath (actually works—activates parasympathetic nervous system)
- Change your physical state (stand up, get water, take a walk)
- Release physical tension consciously

**2. The Cognitive Reframe**
- Ask yourself: "What else could be true here?"
- Consider the other person's perspective
- Focus on what you can control

**3. The Strategic Delay**
- "I'd like to think about that and get back to you"
- Sleep on important decisions
- Write the angry email—then delete it

**4. The Label and Release**
- Silently name the emotion: "I'm noticing I feel defensive right now"
- Naming reduces the power of the emotion

**When You Slip**

You will sometimes lose control. When it happens:
- Acknowledge it quickly
- Apologize if needed
- Learn from it
- Move forward

---

### Lesson 5.3: Social Awareness: Empathy and Organizational Awareness

**Video Script (12-15 minutes):**

Social awareness is the ability to accurately read others and understand organizational dynamics.

**Three Types of Empathy:**

**Cognitive Empathy**
Understanding what someone else is thinking. Taking their perspective intellectually.

**Emotional Empathy**
Feeling what someone else is feeling. Genuine emotional resonance.

**Compassionate Empathy**
Understanding and feeling—plus being moved to help.

Leaders need all three, but cognitive empathy is often the most trainable.

**Building Empathy:**

1. **Suspend Judgment**
   Resist the urge to immediately evaluate. Seek to understand first.

2. **Ask Genuine Questions**
   Not to prove your point, but to understand theirs.

3. **Pay Attention to Non-Verbals**
   What is their body telling you that their words aren't?

4. **Consider Context**
   What pressures might they be facing that you're not aware of?

**Organizational Awareness**

Beyond individual empathy, leaders need to read the organization:
- What are the unwritten rules?
- Where does informal power reside?
- What's the real culture, not just the stated values?
- What tensions exist between groups?

This awareness helps you navigate politics, build coalitions, and drive change effectively.

---

### Lesson 5.4: Relationship Management

**Video Script (10-12 minutes):**

Relationship management is where the other three pillars come together. It's the application of EQ to build genuine connections and influence others positively.

**Key Relationship Management Skills:**

**Building Rapport**
- Find common ground
- Show genuine interest in others
- Remember and reference personal details
- Match energy and communication style

**Managing Conflict**
- Address issues directly but kindly
- Focus on the issue, not the person
- Seek win-win solutions
- Know when to step back

**Inspiring and Influencing**
- Connect to what matters to others
- Paint compelling visions
- Use emotion appropriately
- Lead by example

**Developing Others**
- Provide honest feedback with care
- Challenge and support in equal measure
- Celebrate growth and success
- Create opportunities

---

### Lesson 5.5: EQ in Decision Making

**Video Script (10-12 minutes):**

Emotions aren't obstacles to good decision-making—they're data. The key is learning to use emotional information wisely.

**Emotions as Information:**

When you have a strong emotional reaction to a decision, ask:
- What is this emotion telling me?
- Is there a real concern beneath this feeling?
- Am I reacting to the situation or to something else?

**Balancing Heart and Head:**

1. **Feel first, then analyse**
   Notice your gut reaction. Don't suppress it—examine it.

2. **Name the emotion**
   Is it fear? Excitement? Anxiety about being judged?

3. **Separate facts from feelings**
   What do you actually know versus what you're assuming?

4. **Consider impact on others**
   How will this decision affect the people involved?

5. **Decide, then check in**
   After deciding, notice how you feel. Persistent discomfort may signal something important.

**Avoiding Emotional Traps:**

- Making decisions while angry, fearful, or euphoric
- Avoiding decisions because they're uncomfortable
- Letting past experiences cloud current judgment
- Ignoring emotional data entirely

---

### Case Study: "The Stressed-Out Leader"

**Scenario:** A team leader, Ben, is under immense pressure from his director. He becomes irritable, micromanages his team, and publicly dismisses a team member's concern as "overly sensitive." In a team meeting, when a minor setback is announced, Ben visibly slams his pen on the table and snaps at the presenter.

**Discussion Questions:**
1. Which pillars of EQ is Ben failing to demonstrate?
2. What are his emotional triggers?
3. How is his lack of self-management impacting his team's psychological safety?
4. What self-regulation strategies could he use?

**Analysis Exercise:**
Write a development plan for Ben that addresses each EQ pillar.

---

### Role-Play Exercise: "Mediating a Disagreement"

**Scenario:** Two of your direct reports have conflicting work styles and are in a heated disagreement over how to approach a task. One values speed and agility; the other values precision and planning.

**Your Goal:** Use social awareness (empathy) and relationship management to mediate the conversation. Help each person understand the other's perspective and find a workable solution.

**Practice Points:**
- Listen to understand, not to judge
- Acknowledge both perspectives
- Look for common ground
- Guide toward solutions without imposing your view

# MODULE 6: Decision Making and Problem Solving

## Module Overview
**Duration:** 2-3 hours  
**Format:** Video lessons, case studies, interactive exercises  
**CPD Points:** 2

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, participants will be able to:
1. Apply structured frameworks to make sound decisions under pressure
2. Distinguish between rational, intuitive, and collaborative decision-making approaches
3. Identify and mitigate cognitive biases that impair judgment
4. Lead their teams through complex problem-solving processes

---

### Lesson 6.1: The Anatomy of a Decision

**Video Script (10-12 minutes):**

Every leader is ultimately measured by the quality of their decisions. Today, we're going to give you a framework to make better ones—consistently.

Let's start with what a decision actually is. A decision is a commitment of resources—time, money, attention, reputation—toward a course of action, with the expectation of a particular outcome.

The challenge? Every decision involves uncertainty. If the outcome were guaranteed, there'd be no decision to make.

**The Decision Quality Framework:**

Before making any significant decision, ask yourself:
1. **Is the problem clear?** Are we solving the right problem?
2. **Do we have the right information?** What data would change our minds?
3. **Have we considered alternatives?** What are our options, really?
4. **Have we evaluated the trade-offs?** What are we giving up with each choice?
5. **Is this the right decision-maker?** Am I the best person to make this call?
6. **Can we commit and execute?** Once decided, can we follow through?

**Speed vs. Quality Trade-off**

Jeff Bezos distinguishes between "one-way door" and "two-way door" decisions. One-way doors are irreversible—they deserve careful analysis. Two-way doors can be undone—decide quickly and course-correct.

Most leaders overthink two-way doors and underthink one-way doors. Learn the difference.

---

### Lesson 6.2: Rational Decision-Making Models

**Video Script (10-12 minutes):**

Let's examine structured approaches that bring rigour to your decisions.

**The Rational Model (6 Steps):**
1. Identify the problem
2. Gather relevant information
3. Generate alternatives
4. Evaluate alternatives against criteria
5. Choose the best option
6. Implement and monitor

This works brilliantly for well-defined problems with clear data. But it has limitations in complex, ambiguous situations.

**Decision Matrix Analysis:**

When facing multiple options with multiple criteria:
1. List your options as rows
2. List your criteria as columns
3. Weight each criterion by importance (1-10)
4. Score each option against each criterion
5. Multiply and sum to find the highest-scoring option

This doesn't make the decision for you, but it surfaces your assumptions and trade-offs.

**Pro-Con Analysis (Enhanced):**

Go beyond simple lists:
- Weight the importance of each pro and con (1-10)
- Assign probability to uncertain outcomes
- Consider second-order effects (what happens after the decision?)

---

### Lesson 6.3: Intuitive and Adaptive Decision-Making

**Video Script (10-12 minutes):**

Rational models are essential, but they're not sufficient. In fast-moving, ambiguous environments, intuition becomes invaluable.

**What Is Intuition Really?**

Intuition isn't magic—it's pattern recognition built from experience. When an experienced firefighter "senses" danger, their brain is processing thousands of data points accumulated over years.

The catch? Intuition is only as good as the experience it's built on. Be cautious about trusting intuition in domains where you lack deep experience.

**Recognition-Primed Decision Making (RPD):**

Developed by studying experts under pressure (firefighters, military commanders), RPD describes how experienced leaders actually decide:
1. Recognise the situation type
2. Recall what worked before
3. Mentally simulate the proposed action
4. If it works in your head, act; if not, modify

**When to Trust Your Gut:**
- High-experience domain
- Time pressure
- Patterns are similar to past situations
- Consequences are manageable

**When NOT to Trust Your Gut:**
- New domain with little experience
- High stakes with irreversible consequences
- Data is available but you're ignoring it
- Strong emotions are present

---

### Lesson 6.4: Cognitive Biases in Decision-Making

**Video Script (12-15 minutes):**

Your brain is brilliant but flawed. Understanding cognitive biases is essential for decision-making hygiene.

**Key Biases to Watch:**

**Confirmation Bias**
We seek information that confirms what we already believe. Counter it by actively seeking disconfirming evidence. Ask: "What would prove me wrong?"

**Anchoring**
We over-rely on the first piece of information we receive. Be aware of where your starting assumptions came from.

**Sunk Cost Fallacy**
We continue investing in failing courses of action because we've already invested so much. Ask: "If I were starting fresh today, would I make this choice?"

**Availability Heuristic**
We overweight recent or vivid events. Just because something happened recently doesn't mean it's more likely to happen again.

**Overconfidence**
We consistently overestimate our own knowledge and abilities. Build in reality checks and external perspectives.

**Groupthink**
Teams converge on consensus to avoid conflict. Assign devil's advocates. Create space for dissent.

**Activity: Bias Audit**

Think about a recent significant decision you made. Which of these biases might have influenced your thinking? What would you do differently?

---

### Lesson 6.5: Leading Team Problem-Solving

**Video Script (10-12 minutes):**

The best leaders don't solve all problems themselves—they build problem-solving capability in their teams.

**The Leader's Role:**
- Frame the problem clearly
- Ensure the right people are in the room
- Create psychological safety for ideas
- Facilitate, don't dominate
- Make the final call when consensus isn't possible

**Structured Problem-Solving Frameworks:**

**Root Cause Analysis (5 Whys):**
Keep asking "why" until you get to the underlying cause, not just the symptom.

**Fishbone Diagram:**
Categorise potential causes (People, Process, Technology, Environment) and explore each systematically.

**RAPID Decision Framework:**
Clarify who has each role:
- **R**ecommend: Proposes the solution
- **A**gree: Must sign off before proceeding
- **P**erform: Executes the decision
- **I**nput: Consulted for expertise
- **D**ecide: Has final authority

When everyone knows their role, decisions move faster.

### Case Study: "The Failing Product Launch"

**Scenario:** Six months before launch, a new product is behind schedule and over budget. The team is exhausted and morale is low. Early customer feedback suggests the product may not meet market needs, but the company has already invested £2 million and announced the launch publicly.

The VP of Product must decide: Push forward with the launch as planned? Delay and re-scope? Cancel entirely and write off the investment?

**Discussion Questions:**
1. What cognitive biases might be influencing the decision?
2. What information would you want before deciding?
3. How would you involve your team in this decision?
4. What's the one-way door vs. two-way door analysis here?

---

### Role-Play Exercise: "The Cross-Functional Conflict"

**Scenario:** You're leading a meeting to decide whether to build a new feature in-house or outsource it. Engineering wants to build (more control, skill development). Finance wants to outsource (cost savings, speed). Both have valid points and strong opinions.

**Your Goal:** Facilitate a decision that both sides can commit to, even if they don't fully agree.

**Practice Points:**
- Acknowledge both perspectives before sharing your view
- Surface the underlying values driving each position
- Look for creative options that address both concerns
- Make a clear decision and explain your reasoning

---

# MODULE 7: Delegation and Empowerment

## Module Overview
**Duration:** 2-3 hours  
**Format:** Video lessons, practical exercises, role-plays  
**CPD Points:** 2

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, participants will be able to:
1. Identify tasks appropriate for delegation and match them with the right people
2. Communicate expectations clearly while granting appropriate autonomy
3. Avoid common delegation pitfalls including micromanagement and abdication
4. Build a culture of empowerment that develops future leaders

---

### Lesson 7.1: The Strategic Importance of Delegation

**Video Script (10-12 minutes):**

Here's a truth that most new leaders resist: your job is not to do the work. Your job is to ensure the work gets done—while developing the people who do it.

Delegation isn't about dumping tasks you don't want to do. It's a strategic lever for:
- **Capacity:** You can't do everything. Delegation multiplies your impact.
- **Development:** Stretch assignments grow your team's capabilities.
- **Engagement:** People want meaningful work and autonomy.
- **Succession:** If you can't delegate, you can't be promoted—you're irreplaceable.

**The Delegation Paradox:**

The things you're best at are often the hardest to delegate. But if you keep doing them, you become a bottleneck—and your team never learns.

**What Happens When You Don't Delegate:**
- You're overwhelmed and stressed
- Your team is underutilised and disengaged
- Development opportunities are wasted
- The organisation depends too heavily on one person

**Reflection:** What percentage of your current work could be done by someone else if they were trained properly?

---

### Lesson 7.2: What to Delegate (and What Not To)

**Video Script (10-12 minutes):**

Not everything should be delegated. Let's build a framework.

**Delegation Candidates (Yes):**
- Routine tasks that consume significant time
- Tasks that develop your team members' skills
- Tasks where others have more expertise
- Tasks that could be done "well enough" by someone else
- Decisions that should be made closer to the action

**Keep for Yourself (No):**
- Final accountability for critical outcomes
- Confidential or sensitive personnel matters
- Vision-setting and strategic direction
- Crisis situations requiring immediate senior judgment
- Building key relationships

**The 70% Rule:**

If someone can do the task 70% as well as you, delegate it. They'll learn from doing it, and you'll free time for higher-value work. Perfectionism is the enemy of scale.

**The Delegation Matrix:**

Plot tasks on two axes:
- Vertical: Importance (high/low)
- Horizontal: Your unique value-add (high/low)

High importance + High unique value = Keep
High importance + Low unique value = Delegate with close oversight
Low importance + High unique value = Question why you're doing it at all
Low importance + Low unique value = Delegate or eliminate

---

### Lesson 7.3: The Art of Effective Delegation

**Video Script (12-15 minutes):**

Delegation is a skill. Done poorly, it creates frustration for everyone. Done well, it empowers people and delivers results.

**The Five Rights of Delegation:**

1. **Right Task:** Is this appropriate to delegate?
2. **Right Person:** Does this person have (or can they develop) the capability?
3. **Right Direction:** Have I clearly communicated expectations?
4. **Right Authority:** Have I given them the power to act?
5. **Right Support:** What resources and check-ins do they need?

**The SMART Delegation Conversation:**

When delegating, cover these elements:
- **S**pecific outcome: What does success look like?
- **M**easurable criteria: How will we know it's done well?
- **A**uthority granted: What can they decide? What needs approval?
- **R**esources available: Budget, time, people, tools
- **T**imeline: Deadlines and check-in points

**Script Example:**

"I'd like you to lead the customer satisfaction survey project. Success means a 40%+ response rate and a clear report on the top three improvement areas by month-end. You have authority to design the survey, choose the distribution method, and spend up to £500. I'd like a 10-minute update next Friday. What questions do you have?"

---

### Lesson 7.4: Avoiding the Extremes

**Video Script (10-12 minutes):**

There are two ways to fail at delegation: micromanagement and abdication.

**Micromanagement**

Signs you're micromanaging:
- You check in constantly
- You redo work to your exact specifications
- You require approval for every small decision
- Your team stops taking initiative

Impact: Erodes trust, kills creativity, creates dependency, frustrates top performers.

**Abdication**

Signs you're abdicating:
- You assign tasks and disappear
- You provide no direction, resources, or feedback
- You only show up when things go wrong
- Your team feels unsupported and set up to fail

Impact: Breeds resentment, causes preventable failures, damages your credibility.

**The Sweet Spot: Empowerment with Accountability**

Empowerment means:
- Clear expectations upfront
- Appropriate autonomy for the person's capability level
- Resources and support when needed
- Regular but not excessive check-ins
- Feedback that helps them improve
- Recognition when they succeed

**Situational Calibration:**

New employee + unfamiliar task = More direction, more check-ins
Experienced employee + familiar task = Less direction, more autonomy
Any employee + high-stakes task = Appropriate oversight regardless of experience

---

### Lesson 7.5: Building an Empowerment Culture

**Video Script (10-12 minutes):**

True empowerment isn't about one-off delegation. It's about creating a culture where initiative, ownership, and problem-solving are the norm.

**Characteristics of an Empowerment Culture:**
- People feel safe to take risks and make mistakes
- Decision-making happens close to the action
- Information flows freely
- People understand the "why" behind their work
- Success is celebrated; failures are learned from

**How to Build It:**

1. **Model the Behaviour**
   When you make a mistake, admit it openly. When you don't know something, ask.

2. **Push Decisions Down**
   Ask yourself: "Does this really need to come to me?" Often the answer is no.

3. **Coach, Don't Tell**
   When someone brings you a problem, ask "What do you think we should do?" before offering your solution.

4. **Celebrate Initiative**
   Publicly recognise people who take ownership, especially when the outcome is imperfect but the effort was right.

5. **Remove Barriers**
   Ask your team: "What's getting in the way of you doing your best work?" Then act on what you hear.

### Case Study: "The Micromanager's Wake-Up Call"

**Scenario:** A department head, Daniel, prides himself on his attention to detail. He reviews every document before it goes out, sits in on every meeting, and insists on approving all decisions. His team is competent, but they've stopped bringing ideas—they just wait for Daniel to tell them what to do.

One day, Daniel is out sick for two weeks. Nothing moves. Deadlines are missed. When he returns, he realises the team can't function without him.

**Discussion Questions:**
1. What was Daniel trying to achieve with his behaviour?
2. What were the unintended consequences?
3. If you were coaching Daniel, what would you advise?
4. How can a leader balance high standards with empowerment?

### Role-Play Exercise: "The Delegation Conversation"

**Scenario:** You need to delegate a high-visibility project to a team member who is capable but has never led something this significant.

**Role 1 (Leader):** Conduct the delegation conversation covering: the outcome expected, authority granted, resources available, support offered, and check-in schedule.

**Role 2 (Team Member):** You're excited but nervous. Ask questions to clarify expectations and voice any concerns about your ability to deliver.

**Debrief Questions:**
- Did the leader provide enough clarity?
- Was appropriate authority granted?
- Does the team member feel set up for success?

---

# MODULE 8: Conflict Resolution

## Module Overview
**Duration:** 2-3 hours  
**Format:** Video lessons, case studies, role-plays  
**CPD Points:** 2

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, participants will be able to:
1. Recognise different types and sources of workplace conflict
2. Identify their own conflict style and adapt it to different situations
3. Apply structured approaches to mediate conflict between others
4. Transform conflict from destructive to constructive

---

### Lesson 8.1: Understanding Conflict

**Video Script (10-12 minutes):**

Let's start by reframing how you think about conflict.

Conflict is not inherently bad. In fact, healthy conflict—what we call "constructive tension"—is essential for high-performing teams. It's how we surface different perspectives, challenge weak ideas, and arrive at better solutions.

**The problem isn't conflict. The problem is how we handle it.**

**Types of Workplace Conflict:**

**Task Conflict:** Disagreements about what to do or how to do it
- Often healthy when managed well
- Leads to better decisions through debate

**Relationship Conflict:** Personal friction between individuals
- Usually unhealthy
- Distracts from work and creates toxic dynamics

**Process Conflict:** Disagreements about roles, responsibilities, and procedures
- Can be productive if addressed openly
- Becomes toxic when it's really about power or status

**Sources of Conflict:**
- Scarce resources (budget, headcount, attention)
- Competing goals or priorities
- Communication breakdowns
- Different values or working styles
- Organisational change and uncertainty
- Historical grievances and mistrust

**The Cost of Avoiding Conflict:**

Many leaders avoid conflict hoping it will resolve itself. It rarely does. Instead:
- Problems fester and grow
- Resentment builds silently
- Good people leave
- Performance suffers
- You lose respect as a leader

---

### Lesson 8.2: Conflict Styles and When to Use Each

**Video Script (12-15 minutes):**

We all have default conflict styles. Understanding yours—and knowing when to flex—is key.

**The Thomas-Kilmann Conflict Modes:**

**Competing (High assertiveness, low cooperation)**
Pursuing your interests at the expense of others.
Use when: Quick decisions needed, protecting non-negotiable values
Avoid when: Relationship matters, you might be wrong

**Accommodating (Low assertiveness, high cooperation)**
Giving in to the other person's interests.
Use when: The issue matters more to them, you're wrong, preserving relationship is priority
Avoid when: Core values at stake, sets a precedent you'll regret

**Avoiding (Low assertiveness, low cooperation)**
Sidestepping the conflict entirely.
Use when: Issue is trivial, emotions are too high, you need more information
Avoid when: Problem is important and won't resolve itself

**Compromising (Moderate assertiveness, moderate cooperation)**
Finding middle ground where both give something up.
Use when: Time pressure, goals are moderately important to both
Avoid when: Creative solution is possible, compromise weakens the outcome

**Collaborating (High assertiveness, high cooperation)**
Working together to find a solution that fully satisfies both.
Use when: Issues are too important to compromise, trust is high, time allows
Avoid when: Issue is trivial, one party isn't willing

**Activity: Style Self-Assessment**

Reflect on your last three conflicts. Which style did you default to? Was it the right choice for that situation?

---

### Lesson 8.3: The Leader's Role in Team Conflict

**Video Script (10-12 minutes):**

When conflict arises in your team, your role is not to avoid it—it's to channel it productively.

**When to Intervene:**
- The conflict is affecting work or relationships
- The parties can't resolve it themselves
- The conflict is spreading to others
- One party is bullying or behaving inappropriately

**When NOT to Intervene:**
- The parties are capable of resolving it
- It's minor and likely to pass
- Your intervention would undermine their autonomy
- You don't have full information yet

**How to Intervene:**

1. **Meet Privately First**
   Talk to each party separately. Understand their perspective. What do they want? What are they feeling?

2. **Bring Them Together**
   Facilitate a conversation. Set ground rules: respect, listening, focus on future not past.

3. **Focus on Interests, Not Positions**
   Positions are what people say they want. Interests are why they want it. Often there's common ground at the interest level.

4. **Look for Creative Solutions**
   Brainstorm options that address both parties' core interests.

5. **Get Commitment**
   End with clear agreements on what each party will do differently going forward.

---

### Lesson 8.4: Having Difficult Conversations

**Video Script (12-15 minutes):**

As a leader, you will have difficult conversations. There's no avoiding them. But there are better and worse ways to have them.

**The Difficult Conversation Framework:**

**1. Prepare**
- What's the issue? (Be specific)
- What's your goal for the conversation?
- What might their perspective be?
- What's your emotional state? (Calm down first if needed)

**2. Open**
- State the purpose clearly and neutrally
- "I'd like to talk about the project deadline situation from last week."
- Avoid accusatory openings: "We need to discuss your failure to..."

**3. Listen First**
- Ask for their perspective: "Help me understand what happened from your point of view."
- Listen without interrupting
- Summarise what you heard to confirm understanding

**4. Share Your Perspective**
- Use "I" statements: "I was concerned when..." not "You made me..."
- Focus on behaviour and impact, not character
- Be specific and give examples

**5. Problem-Solve Together**
- "What can we do to prevent this in the future?"
- Look for solutions you both can commit to

**6. Close Constructively**
- Summarise agreements
- Express confidence in their ability to improve
- Schedule a follow-up if appropriate

---

### Lesson 8.5: Transforming Conflict Into Collaboration

**Video Script (10-12 minutes):**

The highest form of conflict resolution isn't just managing conflict—it's using it to build stronger relationships and better outcomes.

**The Conflict Transformation Mindset:**

Instead of asking "How do I make this conflict go away?" ask "What can this conflict teach us?"

Conflict often reveals:
- Misaligned expectations
- Communication breakdowns
- Different values that need to be reconciled
- System problems that need fixing

**Building Psychological Safety:**

Teams with psychological safety have more conflict, not less—but it's constructive conflict.

How to build it:
- Normalise disagreement: "I want to hear pushback"
- Reward people who raise concerns early
- Admit your own mistakes publicly
- Respond to bad news without blame
- Separate ideas from the people who present them

**After the Conflict:**

Don't just move on. Take time to:
- Acknowledge the resolution
- Repair any relationship damage
- Capture lessons learned
- Address any systemic issues that caused the conflict

---

### Case Study: "The Personality Clash"

**Scenario:** Two senior team members—Alex and Jordan—have fundamentally different working styles. Alex is detail-oriented and process-driven; Jordan is big-picture and spontaneous. They're both excellent contributors but are constantly clashing.

The conflict is now affecting the whole team. Others are taking sides. Productivity is suffering.

**Discussion Questions:**
1. Is this task conflict, relationship conflict, or both?
2. What are the underlying interests of each person?
3. As the leader, how would you approach this?
4. Is there a way to leverage their differences as a strength?

---

### Role-Play Exercise: "The Mediation"

**Scenario:** Two of your team members are in conflict. One believes the other took credit for their idea in a recent presentation. The accused party claims they were simply building on a team discussion.

**Role 1 (Leader):** Facilitate a conversation that surfaces both perspectives, addresses the hurt feelings, and finds a way forward.

**Role 2 (Team Member A - Hurt):** You feel undermined and disrespected. You want acknowledgment and a clear policy going forward.

**Role 3 (Team Member B - Accused):** You didn't intend any harm. You feel attacked. You want this to blow over.

# MODULE 9: Time Management and Productivity

## Module Overview
**Duration:** 2-3 hours  
**Format:** Video lessons, practical exercises, productivity tools  
**CPD Points:** 2

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, participants will be able to:
1. Distinguish between being busy and being productive
2. Apply proven prioritisation frameworks to focus on what matters
3. Protect their time from interruptions and low-value activities
4. Design systems and habits that sustain high performance

---

### Lesson 9.1: The Leader's Time Dilemma

**Video Script (10-12 minutes):**

As a leader, time is your scarcest resource. And here's the paradox: the more senior you become, the more demands on your time—and the more your time matters.

**The Brutal Math:**

If you work 50 hours a week, you have 2,600 hours per year. That sounds like a lot. But subtract:
- Meetings (probably 40-60% of your time)
- Email and communication (2+ hours/day)
- Administrative tasks
- Crises and interruptions

What's left for strategic thinking, developing your team, and working on what really moves the needle?

**The Busy Trap:**

Busyness is not the same as effectiveness. Many leaders confuse motion with progress.

Ask yourself:
- What did I accomplish this week that will still matter in a year?
- How much of my time was spent on urgent-but-not-important activities?
- When did I last have time to think, without interruption, about something strategic?

**The Shift:**

Great leaders manage their energy and attention, not just their time. They ruthlessly protect the hours for high-impact work.

---

### Lesson 9.2: Prioritisation Frameworks

**Video Script (12-15 minutes):**

If everything is a priority, nothing is. Let's build your prioritisation toolkit.

**The Eisenhower Matrix:**

Categorise tasks into four quadrants:

| | Urgent | Not Urgent |
|--|--------|------------|
| **Important** | Do Now (Q1) | Schedule (Q2) |
| **Not Important** | Delegate (Q3) | Eliminate (Q4) |

The trap: We spend too much time in Q1 (firefighting) and Q3 (other people's urgencies), and not enough in Q2 (strategic, proactive work).

**The 80/20 Rule (Pareto Principle):**

20% of your activities produce 80% of your results.

Identify your 20%:
- Which activities create the most value?
- Which relationships are most important?
- Which decisions have the biggest impact?

Then ask: Am I spending my time proportionally?

**The "Big Rocks" Method:**

Imagine your week as a jar. Big rocks are your highest priorities. Sand is everything else.

If you put the sand in first, there's no room for the big rocks. But if you put the big rocks in first, the sand fills around them.

Schedule your "big rocks" before anything else. Then let the smaller tasks fit in the gaps.

---

### Lesson 9.3: Protecting Your Time

**Video Script (10-12 minutes):**

Time management isn't just about what you choose to do. It's about what you choose NOT to do.

**Time Thieves:**
- Meetings that should be emails
- Interruptions and "got a minute?" requests
- Perfectionism on low-value tasks
- Other people's emergencies
- Social media and distraction
- Indecision and procrastination

**Defence Strategies:**

**1. Batch Similar Tasks**
Context-switching is expensive. Batch emails, calls, and administrative tasks into dedicated time blocks.

**2. Create "Deep Work" Blocks**
Schedule uninterrupted time for your highest-value work. Treat it like a meeting you can't cancel.

**3. Say No More Often**
Every yes is a no to something else. Before saying yes, ask: "What am I saying no to?"

**4. Manage Expectations**
Let people know when you're available and when you're not. Set response-time norms for email.

**5. Audit Your Calendar**
Review last week's calendar. For each item, ask:
- Did this need to happen?
- Did it need me?
- Did it need to be this long?

---

### Lesson 9.4: Energy Management

**Video Script (10-12 minutes):**

Time management is incomplete without energy management. You can have free time but be too depleted to use it well.

**The Energy Equation:**

Energy comes from four sources:
- **Physical:** Sleep, exercise, nutrition
- **Emotional:** Relationships, purpose, managing stress
- **Mental:** Focus, learning, challenge
- **Spiritual:** Values alignment, meaning, contribution

When any source is depleted, your overall performance suffers.

**Managing Your Energy:**

**1. Know Your Rhythms**
When are you sharpest? Protect that time for your most important work. When do you slump? Schedule low-intensity tasks.

**2. Build Renewal into Your Day**
Short breaks improve focus. Take a walk. Step away from screens. Have a real lunch.

**3. Manage Your Emotional Energy**
Certain people and activities drain you. Others energise you. Be intentional about your exposure.

**4. Prioritise Recovery**
Elite athletes don't train 24/7. Neither should you. Sleep, weekends, and vacations aren't luxuries—they're performance enhancers.

---

### Lesson 9.5: Building Productive Habits and Systems

**Video Script (10-12 minutes):**

Willpower is finite. Systems are sustainable. The most productive leaders don't rely on discipline—they design environments and habits that make productivity automatic.

**Habit Stacking:**

Attach new habits to existing routines.
- After I pour my morning coffee, I will review my top three priorities.
- Before I leave work, I will plan tomorrow's key tasks.
- After each meeting, I will capture action items immediately.

**The Power of Routines:**

**Morning Routine:** Start your day before it starts you. Review priorities. Don't check email first thing—it puts you in reactive mode.

**Shutdown Routine:** End each day intentionally. Close open loops. Capture tomorrow's priorities. Create mental separation from work.

**Weekly Review:** Each week, review: What worked? What didn't? What are next week's priorities?

**Tools and Systems:**

Use whatever works for you, but commit to a system:
- Task management: One trusted place for all tasks
- Calendar: Time-block your priorities
- Notes: Capture ideas and information systematically
- Email: Process to zero regularly (not constantly)

**The 2-Minute Rule:**

If a task takes less than 2 minutes, do it now. Otherwise, schedule it or delegate it.

---

### Case Study: "The Overwhelmed Executive"

**Scenario:** Sarah is a high-performing director who was recently promoted. Her new role has vastly more scope. She's now in back-to-back meetings 8+ hours a day, answers emails until midnight, and hasn't taken a full day off in months. She feels constantly behind and is starting to snap at her team.

**Discussion Questions:**
1. What's the underlying problem here?
2. Which specific strategies from this module would help most?
3. What would you advise Sarah to STOP doing?
4. How can she create space for strategic work?

---

### Role-Play Exercise: "The Unreasonable Request"

**Scenario:** Your manager has asked you to take on a significant new project on top of your already full workload. You know saying yes will mean sacrificing quality on your existing commitments or sacrificing your health.

**Role 1 (You):** Respond to the request in a way that protects your capacity while maintaining the relationship. Offer alternatives or trade-offs.

**Role 2 (Manager):** You really need this done. Push back on initial resistance, but remain reasonable.

---

---

# MODULE 10: Goal Setting and Performance Management

## Module Overview
**Duration:** 2-3 hours  
**Format:** Video lessons, exercises, templates  
**CPD Points:** 2

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, participants will be able to:
1. Set motivating goals that are clear, measurable, and aligned to strategy
2. Translate organisational goals into team and individual objectives
3. Conduct effective performance conversations that drive improvement
4. Balance accountability with support to get the best from people

---

### Lesson 10.1: The Power of Clear Goals

**Video Script (10-12 minutes):**

Goals matter. Research consistently shows that teams with clear, challenging goals outperform those without them.

**Why Goals Work:**
- They focus attention and effort
- They energise and motivate
- They create a sense of progress and purpose
- They enable accountability

**Why Goals Fail:**
- Too vague ("Do better this quarter")
- Too easy (No stretch = no growth)
- Too many (Dilutes focus)
- Not connected to purpose (Why does this matter?)
- No feedback on progress

**Goal-Setting Done Right:**

The best goals are:
- **Clear:** Anyone can understand what success looks like
- **Challenging:** They stretch people beyond comfort zones
- **Meaningful:** They connect to something people care about
- **Measurable:** Progress can be tracked objectively
- **Time-bound:** There's a deadline that creates urgency

---

### Lesson 10.2: Goal-Setting Frameworks

**Video Script (12-15 minutes):**

Let's examine the frameworks that make goal-setting systematic.

**SMART Goals:**

The classic framework:
- **S**pecific: What exactly will be accomplished?
- **M**easurable: How will you know when it's done?
- **A**chievable: Is it realistic (with stretch)?
- **R**elevant: Does it align with broader priorities?
- **T**ime-bound: What's the deadline?

**Example:**
Weak: "Improve customer satisfaction"
SMART: "Increase NPS score from 32 to 45 by Q3 through implementing new customer feedback loop"

**OKRs (Objectives and Key Results):**

Used by Google, Intel, and many high-performing companies:
- **Objectives:** Qualitative, inspiring goals (What we want to achieve)
- **Key Results:** Quantitative, measurable outcomes (How we know we achieved it)

**Example:**
Objective: Become the preferred provider in our market
Key Results:
1. Increase market share from 15% to 22%
2. Achieve Net Promoter Score of 60+
3. Win three industry awards

OKRs are typically ambitious (70% achievement is considered good), reviewed quarterly, and visible across the organisation.

**Cascading Goals:**

Goals should cascade from strategy to teams to individuals:
- Organisation: Strategic priorities
- Department: How does my area contribute?
- Team: What must we deliver?
- Individual: What's my personal contribution?

This creates line-of-sight—everyone can see how their work connects to the bigger picture.

---

### Lesson 10.3: Performance Conversations That Work

**Video Script (12-15 minutes):**

Annual performance reviews are mostly a waste of time. They're backward-looking, anxiety-producing, and too infrequent to drive change.

What works: **Frequent, focused performance conversations.**

**The Performance Conversation Rhythm:**

- **Weekly:** Quick check-ins. What's on track? What's blocked? What do you need?
- **Monthly:** Deeper discussions. Progress toward goals. Development priorities.
- **Quarterly:** Formal review. Goal progress. Feedback. Plan adjustments.

**The CHECK-IN Model:**

**C**onnect: Start with genuine connection. How are you?
**H**ighlights: What's going well? What are you proud of?
**E**xcitement: What are you looking forward to?
**C**hallenges: What's hard right now? Where are you stuck?
**K**ey priorities: What are the most important things to focus on?
**I**nput: What feedback do you have for me?
**N**ext steps: What are you committed to before we meet again?

**Giving Feedback:**

Effective feedback is:
- Timely (Close to the behaviour)
- Specific (Not "great job" but what exactly was great)
- Balanced (Reinforce strengths AND address development areas)
- Future-focused (What to do differently next time)

Use the SBI model:
- **S**ituation: Where and when did the behaviour occur?
- **B**ehaviour: What specifically did the person do?
- **I**mpact: What was the result?

---

### Lesson 10.4: Holding People Accountable

**Video Script (10-12 minutes):**

Accountability is not micromanagement. It's not punishment. It's the follow-through that ensures commitments become results.

**Accountability Without Blame:**

Accountability starts with clarity. When expectations are clear, accountability is simply asking: "Did we do what we said we'd do? If not, why not? What will we do differently?"

**Common Accountability Failures:**
- Expectations weren't clear from the start
- No regular check-ins on progress
- Problems ignored until it's too late
- Only calling attention to failures, not successes
- Inconsistent standards (letting some people slide)

**Building an Accountability Culture:**

1. **Clarify Expectations Upfront**
   "What does success look like? What's the deadline? What resources are available?"

2. **Make Commitments Visible**
   Public commitments are harder to break. Use shared goals, dashboards, team meetings.

3. **Follow Up Consistently**
   Don't just set goals and hope. Check in regularly.

4. **Address Misses Promptly**
   Don't let things slide. Early intervention prevents bigger problems.

5. **Focus on Learning, Not Blame**
   "What happened? What can we do differently?" not "Who's fault is this?"

---

### Lesson 10.5: Performance Problems and Tough Conversations

**Video Script (10-12 minutes):**

Eventually, you will have an underperformer. How you handle it defines you as a leader.

**Diagnosing Performance Problems:**

Before assuming the problem is the person, ask:
- **Clarity:** Do they know what's expected?
- **Capability:** Do they have the skills?
- **Capacity:** Do they have the resources and time?
- **Commitment:** Do they want to do well?
- **Culture:** Is the environment supporting or hindering them?

**The Performance Improvement Conversation:**

**1. Describe the Gap**
"Here's what's expected. Here's what's happening. Here's the gap."

**2. Explore Causes**
"Help me understand what's getting in the way."

**3. Agree on a Plan**
"What will you do differently? How can I support you? What does success look like in 30/60/90 days?"

**4. Document and Follow Up**
Put it in writing. Schedule check-ins. Monitor progress.

**The Hardest Decision:**

If improvement doesn't happen, you may need to exit someone from the team. This is hard but sometimes necessary—for them, for the team, and for you.

Delay helps no one. The person deserves to know where they stand. The team deserves a leader who addresses problems. And you need to free your energy for people who are committed to success.

---

### Case Study: "The Missed Target"

**Scenario:** A team member, James, was assigned a stretch goal of increasing sales 20%. He achieved only 8%. In his self-assessment, he rates his performance as "meets expectations" because the economy was tough and 8% still beat last year.

**Discussion Questions:**
1. Was the original goal well-set?
2. How should the manager approach the performance conversation?
3. What's the difference between an excuse and a legitimate explanation?
4. How do you balance accountability with empathy?

---

### Role-Play Exercise: "The Underperformer"

**Scenario:** A team member has been consistently missing deadlines and the quality of their work has declined over the past quarter. Other team members are starting to notice and resentment is building.

**Role 1 (Leader):** Conduct a performance improvement conversation. Be direct about the problem, curious about causes, and collaborative about solutions.

**Role 2 (Team Member):** You've been dealing with personal issues you haven't shared at work. You're aware you've been struggling but hoped no one would notice.
